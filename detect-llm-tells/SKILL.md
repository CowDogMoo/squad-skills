# Detect LLM Tells

You are scoring text against known indicators that an LLM (rather than a human) wrote it. Your output is a per-unit classification (FLAG / NO-FLAG) with the tell categories that convinced you and a confidence level. The caller decides what to do with flagged units (delete, rewrite, report) — this skill only judges.

# How to use this skill

## Unit of analysis

The "unit" depends on the caller's domain:

- **Prose** (Markdown, READMEs, plain text): one paragraph = one unit. Minimum 2 sentences / ~30 words. Single sentences are too short to score reliably.
- **Code comments**: one comment *block* = one unit. A block is contiguous `//`/`#` lines (or a single `/* ... */` / `""" ... """` chunk). Do not score individual lines in a multi-line block separately.

Skip these regardless of caller domain:

- Code fences and indented code blocks (in prose)
- YAML/JSON/TOML frontmatter
- CLI examples and shell transcripts
- Non-English text — these categories are English-specific
- Compiler/linter directives (`//go:*`, `//nolint`, `# noqa`, `# type:`, etc.)
- `TODO` / `FIXME` / `HACK` / `NOTE` / `XXX` / `BUG(` markers
- License and copyright headers
- Auto-generated content (`// Code generated ... DO NOT EDIT.` and equivalents)

## Cluster scoring (the only reliable rule)

Score each unit against the 8 categories below. Count **distinct categories** that fire — not the total number of individual tells.

| Categories fired | Confidence | Action |
|---|---|---|
| 4 or more | HIGH | FLAG |
| Exactly 3 | MEDIUM | FLAG |
| 1 or 2 | LOW | DO NOT flag — single-category hits are too noisy |
| 0 | — | clean |

A single occurrence of "delve," one "Moreover," or one em-dash is never enough on its own. Convergence is the signal; isolated tells are not.

## Tell categories that count, even at one hit

A few categories are strong enough that one clear example counts toward the cluster:

- **Tier 1 vocabulary** (one Tier 1 word = vocabulary fires)
- **HR-speak openers** ("Certainly!", "Great question!", "I'd be happy to help")
- **Numbered step/phase labels in code comments** (two or more in sequence = strong by themselves; see Category 2)
- **Model-specific opener phrases** (Category 7, full phrases not single words)

For Tier 2/3 vocabulary, transitional phrases, and em-dash use, require **2+ instances** within the same unit before that category fires. Single occurrences are baseline noise.

## What this skill does NOT cover

The caller's `system.md` is authoritative for:

- File discovery (glob patterns, exemptions)
- Edit-mode vs readonly-mode behavior
- Output format
- Whether to keep or delete specific kinds of useful comments
- Compilation/lint verification after changes

If guidance in this skill conflicts with the caller's hard rules, the caller's hard rules win.

# Reference: 8 tell categories

## 1. Telltale Vocabulary

Frequency data from corpus analysis: Kobak et al. (Science Advances, 2025) analyzed 15M PubMed abstracts; PMC12679996 (2025) analyzed 135 AI-influenced terms; GPTZero (2026) analyzed 3.3M texts. COLING 2025 identified RLHF (not training data or architecture) as the primary cause of vocabulary skew.

### Tier 1 — Strongest signals (10x+ overrepresentation in LLM text)

These words appear in LLM output at 10-50x the rate of human writing. Any ONE of these in a unit is enough to fire the vocabulary category; two or more makes it a strong signal.

- **"delve"** — 40x overrepresented in early GPT-4 (2023-2024); dropped to ~8x by mid-2025 after widespread mockery. Still a strong signal in older or untuned outputs.
- **"tapestry"** — ~25x overrepresented. Almost never appears in technical documentation written by humans.
- **"testament"** — ~20x. "This is a testament to..." is a near-certain LLM construction in technical contexts.
- **"vibrant"** — ~15x. Humans use it for colors; LLMs use it for communities, ecosystems, and discussions.
- **"underscore" / "underscores"** — 13.8x (Kobak). "This underscores the importance of..." is a stock LLM construction.
- **"foster"** — ~12x. "Foster collaboration/innovation/growth" is a signature LLM phrase.
- **"showcasing"** — 10.7x (Kobak). Rare in human technical writing.
- **"intricate"** — ~10x. Used by LLMs to describe anything with more than two moving parts.

### Tier 2 — Strong signals (5-10x overrepresentation)

Require 2+ in the same unit before this fires the category.

- **"crucial," "pivotal," "essential"** — LLMs over-qualify importance. Humans say "important" or just let the context speak.
- **"landscape"** (non-geographic) — "the AI landscape," "the threat landscape." ~7x overrepresented in non-geographic contexts.
- **"comprehensive"** — In Kobak's 10-word marker set. "Gain a comprehensive understanding" appears at 120x frequency (GPTZero). Strong signal in technical docs.
- **"meticulous"** — ~6x. "Meticulous attention to detail" is a stock LLM phrase.
- **"particularly"** — In Kobak's 10-word marker set. Humans use it but LLMs cluster it far more densely.
- **"notably"** — In Kobak's 10-word marker set. "Notably, this approach..." is a classic LLM transition-into-emphasis.
- **"noteworthy"** — Validated by PMC study. Part of the LLM significance-inflation pattern.
- **"enhance," "bolster"** — ~5-6x each.

### Tier 3 — Moderate signals (3-5x overrepresentation)

Common in human writing too but appear more often in LLM output. Only count when 2+ cluster in a single unit.

- **Filler verbs**: "leverage," "unlock," "navigate," "harness," "embark," "utilize," "facilitate," "streamline," "spearhead," "ensure," "exhibit"
- **Generic nouns**: "ecosystem," "framework," "dynamic," "interplay," "synergy," "paradigm," "insights"
- **Dramatic openers**: "unleash the power of," "at the forefront of," "pave the way for," "bridging the gap between," "in the realm of"
- **Emphasis adverbs**: "primarily," "particularly" (when clustered), "especially," "significantly"

### Era-specific shifts

LLM vocabulary tells evolve as models are updated and fine-tuned:

- **2023 (early GPT-4)**: "delve," "tapestry," "testament," "vibrant" at peak frequency. "Certainly!" and "Great question!" as openers.
- **2024 (GPT-4-turbo, Claude 3)**: "delve" usage drops ~60% after public awareness. "Crucial," "landscape," "foster" remain strong. Claude introduces "I'd be happy to" as a signature opener.
- **2025 (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5/4)**: Models trained to suppress the most mocked words. "Delve" rare. But "foster," "enhance," "streamline" persist. New tells emerge: "straightforward," "robust," "seamless." RLHF identified as the primary driver of vocabulary tells (COLING 2025: Llama-2-Chat with RLHF showed 267-6697% increases in focal words vs Llama-2-Base without RLHF).
- **2026 (current)**: Watch for: "comprehensive," "walkthrough," "hands-on," "step-by-step" in contexts where humans would just write instructions without labeling them. LLM buzzwords entering everyday human speech (FSU 2025 study) means individual word tells are becoming less reliable — cluster scoring (3+ tells) is more important than ever.

## 2. Structural Patterns

- **Rule of Three**: AI defaults to grouping things in triplets (adjectives, benefits, examples) with unnatural consistency. In human writing, lists of 2, 4, or 5 are equally common. A document where every bullet list has exactly 3 items is suspicious.
  - **Threshold**: 3+ triplet lists in a single document, or a triplet pattern in >50% of bullet lists.
  - **Example**: "fast, reliable, and scalable" / "simplicity, power, and flexibility" / "developers, teams, and organizations" — three triplets in one page is a strong structural signal.
- **Negative parallelism / "Not X, but Y"**: Variations of "not just X, but Y" appeared in ~6% of LLM messages in one dataset vs <0.5% in human writing — a 12x overrepresentation. Identified as "the single most commonly identified AI writing tell" (tropes.fyi). Also includes "It's not X — it's Y" constructions.
- **False ranges**: "From intimate gatherings to global movements" implies a spectrum where none exists. LLMs use this to sound comprehensive without saying anything specific.
- **Mathematically even cadence**: Paragraphs follow textbook patterns, transitions are frictionless, sentence lengths are suspiciously uniform (typically 15-25 words per sentence with low variance). Human writing has higher variance — short punchy sentences mixed with long complex ones.
  - **Threshold**: Compute the coefficient of variation (CV) of sentence lengths in a paragraph. CV < 0.25 across 5+ sentences is suspicious. Human prose typically has CV > 0.35.
- **Formulaic section structure**: Neat headers, bullet points, and parallel constructions throughout. Every section follows the same pattern: topic sentence, 3 bullets, concluding sentence.
- **Bold-first bullets**: Every list item starting with bolded text is a hallmark of AI markdown formatting. Human bullet lists rarely bold the first word of every item.
- **Fractal summaries**: Introductions, section headers, and conclusions all restate the same content at different zoom levels. Humans write forward; LLMs summarize recursively.
- **Suspiciously balanced pros/cons**: When listing advantages and disadvantages, LLMs tend to produce exactly equal numbers of each. Humans are usually biased toward one side.
- **Numbered step/phase labels in comments**: LLMs impose sequential numbering on code comments: "Step 1:", "Step 2:", "Phase 1:", "Phase 2:" etc. Human developers use function decomposition for multi-step logic — they don't write numbered roadmaps through a function body. Variants include `Step N:`, `Phase N:`, `Step N/M:`, `Step N of M:`, `Phase N —`, and bare `Step N` without a colon.
  - **Threshold**: A single numbered step/phase label in a code comment is a moderate signal. Two or more in sequence is a strong structural signal — near-certain LLM output.
  - **NOT a signal**: User-facing output strings, log messages, and progress indicators that show step numbers to end users. Format strings like `format!("Step 1/2: Connecting")` or `fmt.Sprintf("Step 1/2: Connecting")` are code, not comments — never touch these.

## 3. Punctuation and Formatting

- **Em dash overuse**: LLMs use em dashes (—) at 3-5x the rate of typical human technical writers. Often appears where commas, parentheses, or colons would be more natural. Claude in particular is known for heavy em-dash usage — it is Claude's most distinctive formatting tell.
  - **Threshold**: More than 2 em dashes per 500 words of prose in a technical document is elevated. More than 4 per 500 words is a strong signal.
  - **Exception**: Some human writers (especially those influenced by journalism or literary nonfiction) use em dashes heavily. Check whether the frequency is consistent across the whole document or concentrated in specific sections.
- **Markdown in non-Markdown contexts**: Fenced code blocks or Markdown syntax (bold, headers, links) appearing in plain text files, emails, or contexts where Markdown is not rendered.
- **Overly clean formatting**: Perfect consistency in bullet styles, heading levels, and whitespace throughout a long document. Human-written docs accumulate inconsistencies over time as multiple people edit them.
- **Exclamation mark avoidance**: LLMs in "professional" mode almost never use exclamation marks. Human technical writers occasionally do, especially in warnings, tips, or informal docs.

## 4. Tone and Register

- **HR-speak friendliness**: "It's understandable that...," "Great question!," gentle summarizing endings ("Ultimately...," "In conclusion..."). This register is appropriate in customer support but jarring in technical documentation.
  - **Example**: "We understand that getting started can feel overwhelming, but rest assured that..." — no human engineer writes this in a README.
- **Hedging padding**: "It's worth noting," "it's important to remember," "one might argue," "it should be mentioned that" add nothing but word count. In a 500-word section, 3+ hedging phrases is a strong signal.
  - **Threshold**: Count hedging phrases per 500 words. Human baseline: 0-1. LLM typical: 3-6.
- **Overemphasis of importance**: Everything is "fascinating," "captivating," "remarkable," or "a pivotal moment." When every feature is "crucial" and every update is "exciting," nothing actually stands out.
- **Emotional flatness**: Text reads as polished but objective; lacks the subjective punctuation patterns (exclamation marks, ellipses, rhetorical questions, parenthetical asides) that humans naturally use. The voice never wavers, never shows frustration or humor.
- **Compulsive revision, no improvisation**: Reads like it was endlessly edited but never spontaneous. Every sentence is grammatically perfect. Human first drafts (even published ones) have rough edges.
- **Uniform register across topics**: LLMs maintain the same level of formality whether describing a critical security patch or a minor whitespace fix. Humans naturally shift register based on stakes.
- **"Despite its challenges..." formula**: Rigid acknowledgment of problems immediately dismissed with optimism. LLMs rarely let a negative point stand without a "however" or "that said" pivot.

## 5. Transitional Phrases

Overuse of formal transitions. In human technical writing, most paragraphs start with the subject or a short connector ("But," "So," "Also,"). LLMs default to academic-style transitions:

**High-signal transitions** (rare in human tech docs, common in LLM output):

- "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "Indeed," "Notably," "Consequently," "Subsequently," "Accordingly," "Conversely"

**Medium-signal transitions** (used by humans too, but at lower density):

- "It is worth noting," "In terms of," "With regard to," "In light of," "As such," "To that end," "In particular"

**Threshold**: More than 2 high-signal transitions per 500 words is suspicious. More than 4 is a strong signal. Count only prose paragraphs, not bullet lists or headers.

**Not a signal**: "However," "For example," "That said," "In practice" — these are common in both human and LLM writing.

## 6. Technical Documentation-Specific Tells

- **"Correct but useless" descriptions**: Restating what the code does without explaining why. "The `processData` function processes the data" tells the reader nothing they could not see from the function name.
  - **Example of LLM-style**: "This function takes a configuration object and returns a validated configuration." (just restates the signature)
  - **Example of human-style**: "Validates config before the server starts — catches typos in field names that would otherwise cause a cryptic panic 30 seconds into startup."
- **Missing business context**: The "why" behind decisions is absent; only the "what" is documented. LLMs describe mechanisms well but cannot explain motivations they were never told.
- **Knowledge-cutoff disclaimers**: Statements that information is accurate "as of" a certain date, or "at the time of writing." Humans rarely add these to project docs.
- **Suspiciously complete boilerplate**: Perfect JSDoc/docstrings that describe parameters mechanically but add no insight beyond what the type signature already says.
- **Generic README prose under standard headers**: Standard section headers like "Installation," "Usage," "Contributing," and "License" are human convention — virtually every project uses them, and their presence is NOT a tell. The signal is in the **prose under those headers**: if the Installation section says "Getting started is straightforward — simply follow these steps to leverage the full potential of this framework," that is LLM slop. If it says `pip install foo`, that is human.
  - **Rule**: NEVER flag a document solely because it has standard README section headers. Only flag when the prose content under those headers exhibits 3+ tell categories.
- **Artificially comprehensive scope**: LLMs tend to cover every possible sub-topic even when the user asked about one thing. A "Getting Started" guide that covers installation, configuration, deployment, monitoring, and troubleshooting in exhaustive detail is suspicious — humans write focused docs.

### Code Comment-Specific Tells

These patterns apply specifically to LLM-generated code comments:

- **Over-commenting**: LLMs write comments on nearly every line or block. Comment-to-code ratios that far exceed human norms for the language are a density signal. Humans comment selectively.
- **Consistent commenting style**: LLM-generated comments maintain remarkably consistent style, tone, and formatting across an entire codebase. Human codebases accumulate inconsistencies from multiple authors and time periods.
- **LLM vocabulary in code comments**: Code comments containing "ensure," "robust," "comprehensive," "seamless," "leverage" at rates far exceeding human developer norms. Human code comments tend to be terse, informal, and use domain-specific jargon rather than generic adjectives.
- **Mechanically perfect boilerplate**: Every function gets the same doc-comment template with `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` (or language equivalent) that adds no insight beyond the type signature.

## 7. Model-Specific Opening Words and Signatures

These apply to the first sentence of a response or document section:

- **ChatGPT** tends to start with: "As," "Sure," "Certainly," "Here," "Creating," "To," "Let's." The "Certainly!" opener was extremely common in GPT-3.5 and early GPT-4 but has been suppressed in later versions. ChatGPT has the strongest documented vocabulary fingerprint of any model family. Detection rate: ~68% average across detectors.
- **Claude** tends to start with: "I'd," "Based," "Here," "This," "How," "Looking." The "I'd be happy to help" pattern is a strong Claude signal, especially in technical contexts where no help was requested. Claude's strongest formatting tell is em-dash overuse. Distinctive Claude phrases include "complex and multifaceted" (700x more frequent in AI text), "intricate interplay" (100x). Claude has higher burstiness (genuine sentence-length variation) than ChatGPT, making it harder to detect. Detection rate: ~23% average — the least detectable major model.
- **Gemini** tends to start with: "Absolutely," "Great," "Here," "That's a great question." Gemini's tells are structural rather than lexical — heavy reliance on bullet points and numbered lists even when not requested, bold headings and subheadings, strict claim-evidence-conclusion paragraph format. Reads like a well-organized Wikipedia entry. Detection rate: ~61% average.
- **General LLM pattern**: Starting a document or section with a meta-statement about what the document will cover ("In this guide, we'll explore...") rather than just starting the content.

## 8. Caveats and Operationalization

### False positive risks

- No single indicator is conclusive. LLMs learned from human writing, so humans use these patterns too — especially humans who read a lot of LLM output and unconsciously adopt its style (FSU 2025 study found LLM buzzwords are entering everyday human speech).
- Academic and formal business writing naturally uses many of the transitions and structures that flag as LLM tells. Context matters: "Moreover" in a physics paper is normal; "Moreover" in a CLI tool's README is suspicious.
- Non-native English speakers sometimes produce text that triggers vocabulary and structure tells because they learned formal English from textbooks (which LLMs also learned from). Stanford HAI study found 61.3% false positive rate on TOEFL essays from non-native writers.

### Detection accuracy

- Heavy LLM users can detect AI text ~90% of the time (per a 2025 study of 500 participants).
- Automated detection using the tell-category convergence approach (3+ categories) achieves ~85% precision and ~70% recall on mixed corpora.
- ML-based detectors achieve 96-100% accuracy on clean AI text, but drop to 60-70% on paraphrased or humanized content.
- Recall drops to ~40% on text that was prompted with specific style instructions or heavily edited post-generation.

### Temporal drift

- These tells evolve as models are updated. What screams "AI" today may not tomorrow.
- Paraphrasing, editing, or prompting for a specific style can mask most of these signals.
- The strongest long-term signal is not any single word but the combination of uniform cadence + absence of genuine opinion + suspiciously complete coverage of a topic.
- Individual word tells are becoming less reliable as LLM vocabulary enters human speech. Cluster scoring (3+ tell categories converging) remains the most robust detection method.
